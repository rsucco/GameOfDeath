## Game of Death

### How to Play
The rules are the same as [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), but there are two competing forms of life. They don't hunt each other, but they do compete for resources.

The game will start with a 'big bang'. 20% of the squares will spawn a blue cell, 20% will spawn a red cell, and the rest will remain empty. Life is allowed to run for 100 generations, after which the player with the fewest cells begins by playing a number of cells equal to the difference between the two players' cell counts. After that, each player takes turns spawning a number of cells dictated by the number of currently living cells and the length of the current game.
